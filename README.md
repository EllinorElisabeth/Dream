# 🌙 Dreams

Fullstack web application where users can express dreams, thoughts and visions.

Developed initially as a school assignment where the goal was to create a quote manager for Donald Trump (to help admin staff manage his quotes),
this project has since been redesigned into something more personal, positive and universally relevant.

Built with **React + TypeScript** (frontend) and **ASP.NET Core + SQLite** (backend).
